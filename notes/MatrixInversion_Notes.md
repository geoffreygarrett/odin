The choice of the inversion method for the Kalman filter depends on the specific circumstances, as different methods
offer trade-offs between numerical stability, speed, and accuracy.

1. **Direct Inversion**: This is the simplest and most straightforward method. However, it can lead to numerical
   instability, especially for ill-conditioned matrices.

2. **Cholesky Decomposition**: Cholesky decomposition is often used in the context of Kalman filtering due to its
   numerical stability. This method works by decomposing a matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its
   conjugate transpose. The main downside is that it only works for symmetric, positive-definite matrices.

3. **QR Decomposition**: QR decomposition is another numerically stable method used for matrix inversion. It decomposes
   a matrix into an orthogonal matrix (Q) and an upper triangular matrix (R). QR decomposition works for any invertible
   matrix.

4. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: SVD is a powerful method for matrix inversion that works with any matrix. It
   decomposes a matrix into the product of two orthogonal matrices and a diagonal matrix of singular values. However,
   SVD can be computationally intensive, so it may not be the best choice for real-time applications like the Kalman
   filter.

5. **LU Decomposition**: LU decomposition factors a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper
   triangular matrix (U). Like QR and Cholesky, LU decomposition is numerically stable. It's also generally faster than
   SVD, but slower than Cholesky decomposition.

6. **Pseudo Inverse (via SVD or Moore-Penrose method)**: When the matrix is not invertible or it's a non-square matrix,
   the pseudo inverse is used. It's a generalization of the inverse concept. However, it's more computationally
   intensive than some other methods.

For most practical applications in Kalman filtering, the Cholesky decomposition is commonly used due to its good balance
of numerical stability and computational efficiency. However, the best method for your specific case may depend on the
properties of your matrices and the computational resources available. Always consider these factors when choosing an
inversion method.
