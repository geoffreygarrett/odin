The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem
that aims to service a number of customers with a fleet of vehicles. The main goal is to determine
an optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of
customers. The problem is defined over a graph, where the customers are represented by nodes, and
the vehicles must travel along the edges of the graph to reach each customer.

The VRP has a number of variations depending on the specific constraints and requirements of the
problem, including:

1. Capacitated VRP (CVRP): Each vehicle has a certain carrying capacity and cannot exceed it.

2. VRP with Time Windows (VRPTW): Each customer must be serviced within a specific time window.

3. VRP with Pickup and Delivery (VRPPD): Goods are moved from a depot to a set of delivery locations
   and back.

4. VRP with Multiple Depots (MDVRP): There are multiple depots where vehicles can be stationed or
   return to.

Common approaches to solving the VRP include:

1. **Exact algorithms**: These are methods that can solve the VRP to optimality, and include
   approaches like branch and cut, dynamic programming, and integer programming. However, these
   methods can only solve relatively small instances of the problem due to their high computational
   complexity.

2. **Heuristic and Metaheuristic algorithms**: These are methods that can find good solutions,
   though not necessarily optimal, in reasonable computational times. They include approaches like
   local search (e.g., 2-opt, 3-opt), simulated annealing, tabu search, and genetic algorithms.

3. **Vehicle routing software and solvers**: These are specific software applications or solvers
   developed to solve VRPs, such as Google's OR-Tools, VRP Spreadsheet Solver, and others. They
   often incorporate a mix of exact and heuristic methods, and are designed to be flexible to handle
   various types of VRPs and constraints.

4. **Hybrid methods**: These methods combine different types of approaches, for example, using an
   exact method to solve a simplified version of the problem and then applying a metaheuristic to
   refine the solution.

The VRP is NP-hard, meaning that the time required to solve the problem increases quickly with the
size of the problem. Thus, for large-scale real-world problems, heuristic or metaheuristic methods
are often used due to their ability to provide good quality solutions in reasonable times.
