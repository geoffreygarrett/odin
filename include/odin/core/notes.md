Here are the key points about serialization and Google's Protocol Buffers:

1. **Serialization Importance**:
    - Serialization is essential for preserving application state, inter-process communication, or network data transmission.
    - It allows conversion of complex data structures into a format that can be stored/transmitted and later reconstructed.

2. **Why Use Google's Protocol Buffers (protobuf)**:
    - **Efficiency**: Protobuf is highly efficient, providing fast serialization/deserialization and compact serialized data, outperforming formats like JSON or XML.
    - **Language Agnostic**: Protobuf supports numerous programming languages, making it versatile for applications with components in different languages.
    - **Schema Evolution**: Protobuf supports the addition of new fields to data formats without breaking compatibility with older versions, vital for evolving applications.
    - **Binary Format**: The use of binary format by protobuf makes it space-efficient. However, note that binary data is not human-readable.
    - **Tooling and Community**: A mature ecosystem and a broad community back protobuf, providing ample resources for learning and troubleshooting.

3. **Contextual Fit**:
    - In the context of a simulation, serialization allows saving and resuming of states, even on different machines or processes.
    - Protobuf, with its efficiency and versatility, can be an excellent choice for such a task.
    - The "best" library, however, depends on specific application requirements and constraints.
